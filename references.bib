  journal   = {Applied Physics Express},
  abstract  = {The spatial arrangement of molecule adsorbates on a metal surface is very difficult to predict via first-principles calculations and standard optimizing algorithms. In this Letter, we show that a machine learning technique called Bayesian optimization can optimize the arrangement of two medium-sized aromatic adsorbates on a copper (111) surface within tens of density functional theory energy evaluations. The methodology reported here is therefore a step toward first-principles structure predictions for chemically modified surfaces, without the need to first specify the arrangement of molecule adsorbates from experimental data.}

  journal   = {Japanese Journal of Applied Physics},
  abstract  = {Crystalline interfaces have a tremendous impact on the properties of materials. Determination of the atomic structure of the interface is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the interface properties. Despite this importance, extensive calculation is necessary to determine even one interface structure. In this study, we apply a technique called kriging, borrowed from geostatistics, to accelerate the determination of the interface structure. The atomic structure of simplified coincidence-site lattice interfaces were determined using the kriging approach. Our approach successfully determined the most stable interface structure with an efficiency almost 2 orders of magnitude better than the traditional “brute force” approach.}

  journal   = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
  abstract  = {The accurate description of van der Waals forces within density functional theory is currently one of the most active areas of research in computational physics and chemistry. Here we report results on the structural and energetic properties of graphite and hexagonal boron nitride,  two layered materials where interlayer binding is dominated by van der Waals forces. Results from several density functionals are reported, including the optimized Becke88 van der Waals (optB88-vdW) and the optimized PBE van der Waals (optPBE-vdW) (Klimeš et al 2010 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter  22 022201) functionals. Where comparison to experiment and higher-level theory is possible, the results obtained from the two new van der Waals density functionals are in good agreement. An analysis of the physical nature of the interlayer binding in both graphite and hexagonal boron nitride is also reported.}
